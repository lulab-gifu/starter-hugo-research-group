        Our research group focuses on **discrete mathematics** (**combinatorics**) and **combinatorial algorithms**, as well as theoretical aspects on **coding theory** and **cryptography**, which are fundamental theories for information communication and security. Recently, we are actively applying **constraint programming** techniques to combinatorial and information-theoretical problems.
